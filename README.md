# OS-DEV
A collection of codes written while studying os-dev from <b>"Writing a Simple Operating System â€” from Scratch"</b> By <i>Nick Blundell.</i>


All codes for boot sector programming are compiled using command:
```
  $> nasm input_file.asm -f bin -o output_file.bin
```

To run the boot sector code, use `bochs` or `qemu`.
